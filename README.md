## Reason

Continuous learning is one of the essential things that make up the *ethos of SoftwarePark*. As we gain new experience from our work, we want to capture the lessons learned and spread them within the company. This includes Domain-Driven Design practices as well as software engineering ideas from the specific domains. To help with that, we are doing short series of exercises within the different domains.

While doing that we will keep exercises public and transparent. Perhaps, somebody else would find them helpful or entertaining.
